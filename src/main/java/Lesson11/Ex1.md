A savings account typically accrues savings using compound interest. If you deposit $1,000 with a 10% interest rate per year, then after one year you have a total of $1,100. If you leave this money in the account for another year at 10% interest, then after two years the total will be $1,210. After three years, you would have $1,331, and so on.

Write a program that inputs the amount of money to deposit, an interest rate per year, and the number of years the money will accrue compound interest. Write a recursive function that calculates the amount of money that will be in the savings account using the input information.

To verify your function, the amount should be equal to  , where P is the amount initially saved, i is the interest rate per year, and n is the number of years.
